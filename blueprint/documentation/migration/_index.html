	<h1>Migrating from Spring Dynamic Modules to Eclipse Gemini Blueprint</h1>
	
	
	<p>This guide is aimed at helping developers using Spring DM in their application to migrate to Eclipse Gemini Blueprint. Note that the migration 
	to the Eclipse Foundation is not yet complete and this document might not reflect all the changes that occurred in the process. See the 
	support page for more info on getting accurate information.</p>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Gemini Blueprint was created through the migration of Spring Dynamic Modules to the Eclipse Foundation. While certain things have
	changed in the process, mainly to reflect the new project name and hosting infrastructure, the project architecture, ideas, code base and dependencies
	have remained intact. Use this to your advantage when encountering errors, by looking first for references to 'old' packages or classes as these are likely
	to be the problem in the vast majority of cases.
	</p>
	
	<h2>1.0.0.M1</h2>
	
	<h3>Changed Package Name</h3>
	<p>The most disruptive change for Spring DM users when transitioning to Gemini Blueprint is the renaming of the project packages: 
	from <tt>org.springframework.osgi</tt> to <tt>org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint</tt>. If you are referring to the Spring DM classes, in any way,
	either inside Java code or XML configuration, you need to update the package.<br/>
	The actual class names and method signatures have <b>not</b> been changed so in most cases the changed can be accommodated through a simple "search & replace"
	operation.<br/>
	Note that for configuration purposes, one can shield itself from the package change by relying on the Spring DM/Eclipse Gemini Blueprint namespaces 
	which hide the actual classes used for configuring, making the change transparent.	 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Changed Namespace/Schema Location</h3>
	<p>While not yet implemented in M1, the existing Spring DM schema definition (named <tt>spring-osgi.xsd</tt> and located at <tt>http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi</tt>)
	will be renamed and moved according to the existing Eclipse patterns. For M1, developers can still rely on the old location or, if versioning is used, use <tt>spring-osgi-2.0.0.m2</tt>.
	Be advised that this <b>will change</b> in the upcoming releases.
	
	<h3>Removed deprecated classes</h3>
	<p>During the move, several deprecated or unused classes have been removed. If you cannot find a class name in the new package, it's likely that it has been removed in the process. Feel free
	to confirm this over the forums. Once the migration completes, we plan to provide a complete list of classes removed in this document.</p>
